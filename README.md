## About

Grasp.js is a hand grip pattern recognition micro-library for mobile devices.

This standalone library uses the available sensors on a mobile device as well as how various gestures are performed to detect which hand may be holding the phone.

## Examples

### JavaScript

```JavaScript
  // TODO
```

### CoffeeScript

```CoffeeScript
  # TODO
```

## Install Choices
- `bower install graspjs`
- [download the zip](https://github.com/daniellmb/graspjs/archive/master.zip)

## Tasks

All tasks can be run by simply running `gulp` or with the `npm test` command, or individually:

  * `gulp lint` will lint source code for syntax errors and anti-patterns.
  * `gulp gpa` will analyze source code against complexity thresholds.
  * `gulp test` will run the jasmine unit tests against the source code.
  * `gulp test-coffee` will run the jasmine unit tests against the CoffeeScript source code.
  * `gulp test-min` will run the jasmine unit tests against the minified code.
